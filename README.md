# Project-jquery

Mission:

Welcome the you new first company !
Here is the website you need to intergrate for mobile and desktop (screenshots)
The content is available in the file content.txt and the font/color in the font-colors.txt
You have to use Bootstrap for the layout. Fontawesome for the icons (facebook, twitter, dribble, location-arrow).
The website need to have menu fixed on top and smoothscroll on the internal links.
About the form, the button is disable until the checkbox is checked. And you have to replace the form with a confirmation message when submitted.
Good luck.
